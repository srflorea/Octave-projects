This project was made in Octave GNU.
The scope of this project was to evaluate the interpolation and aproximation
polynoms and the performances of those.
Obiectives:
	- analyze the convergence of the interpolation polynoms
	- compare the interpolation and aproximation polynoms for continuous and
	discreet case
	- estimate the error done in the interpolation process
